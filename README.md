# Large-Scale Riemannian Meta-Optimization via Subspace Adaptation

This repository is the implementation of paper: "Large-Scale Riemannian Meta-Optimization via Subspace Adaptation".

We provide the code of optimizing orthogonal ResNet18 networks on the CIFAR10 dataset.

Prerequisites
-------
Our code requires PyTorch v1.0 and Python 3.

Training our model.
-------

We train the optimizer by
```
python train.py
```

You can modify ```config.py``` to set more detailed hyper-parameters.
